    Deliver the goods by processing the PACK and raw products by delivery order

    You will find a sequence diagram describing states and endpoints
    relationships [here](../docs/delivery_shipment_diag_seq.png).
    Keep [the sequence diagram](../docs/delivery_shipment_diag_seq.plantuml)
    up-to-date if you change endpoints.

    Three cases:

    * Manager assign shipment advice to loading dock, plan its content and start them
    * Manager assign shipment advice to loading dock without content planning and start them
    * Operators create shipment advice on the fly (option “Allow shipment advice creation”
      in the scenario)

    Expected:

    * Existing packages are moved to customer location
    * Products are moved to customer location as raw products
    * Bin packed products are placed in new shipping package and shipped to customer
    * A shipment advice is marked as done
