This module introduces the concept of routing flows in order to manage
different delivery routes for a warehouse.

The default behavior of Odoo allows you to have only one delivery route per
warehouse (with one, two or three steps).
With this module, you are now able to manage multiple delivery routes (having
their own rules and operation types), the right one being selected automatically
based on some criterias, like the carrier and any attribute of the stock move
to process.

This allows you to define a delivery route based on the type of goods to ship,
for instance:

* whole pallet (pick + ship)
* cold chain goods
* dangerous goods

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

Got to "Inventory > Settings > Routing Flows".

A routing flow can be seen as a helper to generate a delivery route (like the
warehouse is doing automatically). The new route will get its own rules and
operation types that doesn't overlap with the default ones of the warehouse.

A routing flow is responsible to change the warehouse delivery route of a move
by another one depending on some criterias:

* the initial outgoing operation type (usually the default one)
* the carrier
* a custom domain (applied on the move)

This way you are able to change the route a move will take depending on its
carrier and, for instance, the type or the packaging of the product
you want to ship.

Usage
=====

When a stock move is confirmed, if a flow is matching all the criteria then
the new delivery route will be automatically applied.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Currently, the module supports only delivery routes, but it could improved to
support reception routes as well.
