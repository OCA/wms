Frontend for Shopfloor app.

The work is organized in scenario.
A scenario represents a process in the warehouse (eg: receive, deliver).
The app allows to start each process through the main menu.

Each scenario is linked to a specific menu item which can be configured in the backend.
Each scenario drives you through the work to do.


Tech details
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* This frontend is built on top of `VueJS <vuejs.org>`_  and `VuetifyJS <vuetifyjs.com/>`_
  and relies on `shopfloor` module that exposes REST API in Odoo
  (based in turn on `base_rest <https://github.com/OCA/rest-framework/tree/13.0/base_rest>`_).

* The whole business logic comes from `shopfloor` module,
  this module takes care of providing a nice and reactive UI to work with.

* No Odoo JS is used, no assets machinery used.

  Static assets are loaded straight, served by a specific controller.
  This app is a Single Page App, hence resources are loaded only once.

  The version of the module appended to the URL of each resources
  makes sure it's not cached when the version changes.

* When developing you can use a demo mode which allows to define interactive scenario
  with pure JS demo data, without interacting with Odoo.
  Nothing to deal with Odoo demo data.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Please refer to `shopfloor_mobile_custom_example`.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Split module by scenario
* Improve documentation and demo data
* Document each component
* Document demo mode
* Find / create a nice icon
* Finish base translations (move all UI strings to translatable terms)
* Use SCSS
* Refactor states definition

  States are now part of the scenario data. They should be specific objects with their own class.
  They should also provide all the actions that should be displayed w/ their handlers when needed.
  Actions can be popup actions or buttons at the bottom of the screen.
  The tricky part here could be how to register this states for the given component.
  Today states have access to the full object of the scenario component as they are part of it.
  `_get_state_spec` could probably lookup for registered states
  (eg: when you register a component in the registry you should provide states as well).
  When we'll have states in this fashion we should also consider if they should provide their own template.
  This way the component template will hold only the generic bits of the scenario.

* Back buttons should be smarter

  In some cases getting back using history is fine but very often this could lead to outdated data display.
  To mitigate this in particular scenario's steps, custom handlers for the back action have been implemented.
  For instance, in cluster_picking when you hit back on manual selection it forces the state to go to start and reload.
  For starting we should provide `on_back` property to all states where we want to display it
  (no more specific check on the state to display this button).
  This part is also related to "Refactor states definition".

* Go through `_.forEach` and similar calls to replace them w/ vanilla JS (eg: `.map()`)
