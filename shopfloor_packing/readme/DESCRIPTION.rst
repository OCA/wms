In a two-step delivery process (or more), packing is a major task.
It is essential that the picking scenario helps operators to put products from
the same order into packages, when collecting multiple orders at the same time.

This module adds a new configuration option to the "cluster picking" scenario,
enabling the packing of pickings into packages.
When this option is activated, the operator will be prompted to pack the
products of the same picking.
In the background, a package will be created and set as the destination for
the stock move lines.
