This addon adds a selection criteria on the release channel based on the shipping
method.

When you don't classify your deliveries in different operation types per shipping
method, then you can use this criteria to filter the selection of valid release
channels. While you could achieve the same with the domain provided on the base
release channel module, this criteria provides a more explicit configuration
and also performs better.
