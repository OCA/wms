DEPRECATED: This module is deprecated in favor of stock_picking_partner_note,
which is now used in shopfloor to display notes in the app.


Adds the option to choose predefined messages for the
parameter "Checkout Packing Info", that is set on Customers
and reused in other places, mainly pickings. These new messages
are archived instead of deleted, to keep track of old messages
associated to existing (or archived) Customers.

The new predefined messages can be created directly in the partner
or in the menu Inventory > Settings > Shopfloor.
