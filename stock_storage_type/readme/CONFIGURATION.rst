Got to "Inventory > Settings > Storage Types", to define Package Storage Types
and Location Storage Types.

Package Storage Type can be defined on Product Packaging form view from the
product form view.

Location Storage Type can be added to any stock location and will be computed
automatically as Allowed Locations Storage Types on said stock location's
children location.
