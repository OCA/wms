This is an extensions for putaway with storage types (provided by
``stock_storage_type``).

In a warehouse, some areas where goods are put cannot be accessed directly and
need to be moved to a buffer first (for instance, because they need a special
machine to move from the buffer to the bins).

In this situation, when we have several buffers each serving several bays, e.g.
10 buffers in front of 10 alleys, we want to avoid putting everything in the
alley 1 if anyway the buffer is full.

This module allows to define buffers in front of a set of locations. When a
buffer contains something or has move lines that reaches it, all the locations
are removed from the put-away computation.

This is specially useful when used with ``stock_dynamic_routing`` with a
configuration that adds an additional move going through the buffer when
we have to reach these areas.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
