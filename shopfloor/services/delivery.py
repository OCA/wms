    Methods for the Delivery Process

    Deliver the goods by processing the PACK and raw products by delivery order.
    Last step in the pick/pack/ship steps. (Cluster Picking → Checkout → Delivery)

    Multiple operators could be processing a same delivery order.

    Expected:

    * Existing packages are moved to customer location
    * Products are moved to customer location as raw products
    * Bin packed products are placed in new shipping package and shipped to customer

    Every time a package, product or lot is scanned, the package level and move line
    are set to done. When the last line is scanned, the transfer is set to done.
    Data for the last transfer for which we have been scanning a line if it is not done.
    When a transfer is scanned, it returns its data to be shown on the screen.
