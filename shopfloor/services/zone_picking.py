    Methods for the Zone Picking Process

    Zone picking of move lines.

    Note:

    * Several operation types could be linked to a single menu item
    * If several operator work in a same zone, theyâ€™ll see the same move lines but
      will only posts theirs when unloading their goods, which means that when they
      scan lines, the backend has to store the user id on the move lines

    Workflow:

    1. The operator scans the zone location with goods to pick (zone location
       meaning a parent location, not a leaf)
    2. If the zone contains lines from different picking types, the operator
       chooses the type to work with
    3. The client application shows the list of move lines, with an option
       to choose the sorting of the lines
    4. The operator selects a line to pick, by scanning one of:

       * location, if only a single move line there; if a location is scanned
         and it contains several move lines, the view is updated to show only
         them
       * package
       * product
       * lot

    5. The operator scans the destination for the line they scanned, this is where
       the path splits:

       * they scan a location, in which case the move line's destination is
         updated with it and the move is done
       * they scan a package, which becomes the destination package of the move
         line, the move line is not set to done, its ``qty_done`` is updated
         and a field ``shopfloor_user_id`` is set to the user; consider the
         move line is set in a buffer

    6. At any point, from the list of moves, the operator can reach the
       "unload" screens to unload what they had put into the buffer (scanned a
       destination package during step 5.). This is optional as they can directly
       move whole pallets by scanning the destination in step 5.
    7. The unload screens (similar to those of the Cluster Picking workflow) are
       used to move what has been put in the buffer:

       * if the original destination of all the lines is unique, screen allows
         to scan a single destination; they can use a "split" button to go to
         the line by line screen
       * if the lines have different destinations, they have to scan the destination
         package, then scan the destination location, scan the next package and its
         destination and so on.

    The list of move lines (point 4.) has support functions:

    * Change a lot or pack: if the expected lot is at the very bottom of the
      location or a stock error forces a user to change lot or pack, user can
      do it during the picking.
    * Declare stock out: if a good is in fact not in stock or only partially.
      Note the move lines may become unavailable or partially unavailable and
      generate a back-order.
