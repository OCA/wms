    Methods for the Cluster Picking Process

    The goal of this scenario is to do the pickings for a Picking Batch, for
    several customers at once.
    The process assumes that picking batch records already exist.

    At first, a user gets automatically a batch to work on (assigned to them),
    or can select one from a list.

    The scenario has 2 main phases, which can be done one after the other or a
    bit of both. The first one is picking goods and put them in a roller-cage.

    First phase, picking:

    * Pick a good (move line) from a source location, scan it to confirm it's
      the expected one
    * Scan the label of a Bin (package) in a roller-cage, put the good inside
      (physically). Once the first move line of a picking has been scanned, the
      screen will show the same destination package for all the other lines of
      the picking to help the user grouping goods together, and will prevent
      lines from other pickings to be put in the same destination package.
    * If odoo thinks a source location is empty after picking the goods, a
      "zero check" is done: it asks the user to confirm if it is empty or not
    * Repeat until the end of the batch or the roller-cage is full (there is
      button to declare this)

    Second phase, unload to destination:

    * If all the goods (move lines) in the roller-cage go to the same destination,
      a screen asking a single barcode for the destination is shown
    * Otherwise, the user has to scan one destination per Bin (destination
      package of the moves).
    * If all the goods are supposed to go to the same destination but user doesn't
      want or can't, a "split" allows to reach the screen to scan one destination
      per Bin.
    * When everything has a destination set and the batch is not finished yet,
      the user goes to the first phase of pickings again for the rest.

    Inside the main workflow, some actions are accessible from the client:

    * Change a lot or pack: if the expected lot is at the very bottom of the
      location or a stock error forces a user to change lot or pack, user can
      do it during the picking.
    * Skip a line: during picking, for instance because a line is not accessible
      easily, it can be postponed, note that skipped lines have to be done, they
      are only moved to the end of the queue.
    * Declare stock out: if a good is in fact not in stock or only partially. Note
      the move lines will become unavailable or partially unavailable and will
      generate a back-order.
    * Full bin: declaring a full bin allows to move directly to the first phase
      (picking) to the second one (unload). The scenario will go
      back to the first phase if some lines remain in the queue of lines to pick.

    You will find a sequence diagram describing states and endpoints
    relationships [here](../docs/cluster_picking_diag_seq.png).
    Keep [the sequence diagram](../docs/cluster_picking_diag_seq.plantuml)
    up-to-date if you change endpoints.
