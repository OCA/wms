Shopfloor is a barcode scanner application for internal warehouse operations.

The application supports scenarios, to relate to Operation Types:

* Cluster Picking
* Zone Picking
* Checkout/Packing
* Delivery
* Location Content Transfer
* Single Pack Transfer

This module provides REST APIs to support the scenarios. It needs a frontend
to consume the backend APIs and provide screens for users on barcode devices.
A default front-end application is provided by ``shopfloor_mobile``.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
   `More details on development status <https://odoo-community.org/page/development-status>`_

Configuration
=============

Profiles
~~~~~~~~

In Inventory / Configuration / Shopfloor / Profiles.

The profiles are used to restrict which menus are shown on the frontend
application. When a user logs in the scanner application, they have to
select their profile, so the correct menus are shown.

Menus
~~~~~

In Inventory / Configuration / Shopfloor / Menus.

The menus are displayed on the frontend application and store the configuration
of the scenarios. Each menu must use a scenario and defines which Operation Types
they are allowed to process.

Their profile will restrict the visibility to the profile chosen on the device.
If a menu has no profile, it is shown in every profile.

Some scenarios may have additional options, which are explained in tooltips.

Logs retention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Logs are kept in database for every REST requests made by a client application.
They can be used for debugging and monitoring of the activity.

The Logs menu is shown only with Developer tools (``?debug=1``) activated.

By default, Shopfloor logs are kept 30 days.
You can change the duration of the retention by changing the System Parameter
``shopfloor.log.retention.days``.

If the value is set to 0, the logs are not stored at all.

Logged data is: request URL and method, parameters, headers, result or error.

Usage
=====

An API key is created in the Demo data (for development), using
the Demo user. The key to use in the HTTP header ``API-KEY`` is: 72B044F7AC780DAC

Curl example::

  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8069/shopfloor/user/menu" -H  "accept: */*" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -H "API-KEY: 72B044F7AC780DAC"

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* improve documentation
* split out scenario components to their own modules
