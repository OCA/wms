Support actions available from any Service Components.

To use an Action Component, a Service component

Difference with Service components:

* Public methods of a Service Components are exposed in the REST API,
  Action Components are never exposed

An Action component can be get from Service or Action Components using

and processes between Services, avoid having too much logic in
Services.
