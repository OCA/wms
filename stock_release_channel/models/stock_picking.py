        This method is meant to be inherited in other modules to add more criteria of

        picking(s) based on the picking information.

        For example, you could define release channels based on a geographic area.

        channel based on the shipping destination. In such a case, it's more
        efficient to search for a channel where the destination is in the channel
        area than to search for all the channels and then filter the ones that match
        the destination as it's done into the method assign_release_channel of the
        stock.release.channel model.
