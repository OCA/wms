This module allows to define preferred shipping methods in order to fine tune
the selection of proper delivery carrier from delivery operations according to
the quantity available to promise.

Moreover it provides the possibility to force the recomputation of preferred
delivery carrier on the release of operations for Delivery Orders.

Configuration
=============

Go to Inventory > Configuration > Delivery > Preferred Shipping Methods to
define new Preferred Shipping Methods.

A Preferred Shipping Method can either define a specific Delivery Method or
use the partner's defined Delivery Method.

These Preferred Shipping Methods will then be filtered out according to the
picking's estimated shipping weight.

Estimated shipping weight calculation relies on `product_total_weight_from_packaging`,
i.e. packaging weight if defined, with a fallback on product weight and uses
the quantity available to promise only.
