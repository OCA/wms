This module builds on the Reception Screen module (in OCA/wms) and the Stock
Measuring Device module (in OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse) to allow the
operator to measure and weigh a package directly from the reception screen.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage
=====

In the reception screen, click on the "Measure Current Packaging" button
(visible if the packaging of the reception is set and has not
weight/dimensions), and use the measuring device. The values should be directly
updated on the packaging.

Known limitation: this only works on the measuring device flagges as default.
