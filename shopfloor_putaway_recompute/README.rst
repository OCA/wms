Use Cases / Context
===================

When the operator starts an operation, if the configuration has changed
(putaways), the destination location could be the wrong one.

So, when launching the 'Get Work', we need to recompute the putaways for
the selected move lines.

Configuration
=============

See configuration in stock_putaway_recompute module.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  Extends it to support more scenarios.
