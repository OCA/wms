Shopfloor is a barcode scanner application.

This module provides REST APIs to support scenario. It needs a frontend
to consume the backend APIs and provide screens for users on barcode devices.
A default front-end application is provided by ``shopfloor_mobile_base``.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
   `More details on development status <https://odoo-community.org/page/development-status>`_

Configuration
=============

Shopfloor config menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the main menu (or home screen) click on "Shopfloor".


Profiles
~~~~~~~~

In Shopfloor / Profiles.

The profiles are used to restrict which menus are shown on the frontend
application. When a user logs in the scanner application, they have to
select their profile, so the correct menus are shown.

Menus
~~~~~

In Shopfloor / Menus.

The menus are displayed on the frontend application.
The configuration may come from the menu itself
and/or from the scenario linked to it.

Their profile will restrict the visibility to the profile chosen on the device.
If a menu has no profile, it is shown in every profile.

Some scenario may have additional options.


Scenario
~~~~~~~~

In Shopfloor / Scenario.

A Scenario represents a flow (or more basically "something to do" with the app.
Each scenario must have a name and a unique key.
The key must match a registered shopfloor service component.

Usage
=====

An API key is created in the Demo data (for development), using
the Demo user. The key to use in the HTTP header ``API-KEY`` is: 72B044F7AC780DAC

Curl example::

  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8069/shopfloor/user/menu" -H  "accept: */*" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -H "API-KEY: 72B044F7AC780DAC"
