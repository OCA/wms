This addons define an automatic release mode on the release channels. By default
release channels manage the release of the transfers in batch mode. This means
that the transfers are released only when the user manually triggers the release
process by clicking on the release button.

When the automatic release mode is enabled, the transfers are released automatically
when a new transfer is added to the channel or as soon a product becomes available.

As for the batch mode, the automatic release process is only active on open channels.
When is locked, the automatic release process is stopped. Once the channel is unlocked,
the automatic release process is restarted and transfers into the channel are released
if they are ready to be released (IOW if quantities are available for moves not
yet released).
