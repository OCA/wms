Allow to extend a reservation to the full content of the source location.

For example, if you have a reassort move for 2 units but the source location
contains 20 units, this module allows to extend the reservation to the 20 units
to move the complete content of the source location.

This can typically be used with shopfloor location content transfer scenario.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

On the operation type, configure if the full reservation button action is visible on related transfers

You can also configure the option 'Merge Move For Full Location Reservation' if you
want only one move at the end. WARNING: The original move will be lost.
