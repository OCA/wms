This module integrates the release channels with sales.

Thanks to it, a sale user is able to force the release channel to use in deliveries,
ignoring the customer preferences.

Usage
=====

* On a sale order form, open the tab *Other info*
* In the *Delivery* section, you can set the field *Force Release Channel*.
  The release channels you can select are filtered based on the warehouse you
  could have selected in the same *Delivery* section.
* Once the order is confirmed, the delivery will get its channel assigned as usual
  by taking the one set on the related order.
